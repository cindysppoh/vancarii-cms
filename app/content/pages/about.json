Much more than a brand, Vancarii is a state of being, a flow of consciousness that eternally converts chaos into serenity. Vancarii is a way of life, chosen by ones who have felt too much and been too strong. This state of being unites us and guides us on. Everything else is just noise. \n\nIn the happiest moments, perhaps when I'm cuddling with my two dogs, I have always felt a strong sense of connection to the human condition. Everyone has been wronged in some way, but we hold on to the moments we love and keep on going. At Vancarii, as with in life, we are in the business of collecting and spreading joy. \n\n<!--EndFragment-->"
